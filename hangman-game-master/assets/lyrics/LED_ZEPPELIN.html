        <h4>"Stairway to Heaven"</h4>

        <p>There's a lady who's sure<br>
            All that glitters is gold<br>
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
            When she gets there she knows<br>
            If the stores are all closed<br>
            With a word she can get what she came for<br>
            Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven</p>

        <p>There's a sign on the wall<br>
            But she wants to be sure<br>
            'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings<br>
            In a tree by the brook<br>
            There's a songbird who sings<br>
            Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving</p>

        <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
            Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>

        <p>There's a feeling I get<br>
            When I look to the west<br>
            And my spirit is crying for leaving<br>
            In my thoughts I have seen<br>
            Rings of smoke through the trees<br>
            And the voices of those who standing looking</p>

        <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
            Ooh, it really makes me wonder</p>

        <p>And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune<br>
            Then the piper will lead us to reason<br>
            And a new day will dawn<br>
            For those who stand long<br>
            And the forests will echo with laughter</p>

        <p>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow<br>
            Don't be alarmed now<br>
            It's just a spring clean for the May queen<br>
            Yes, there are two paths you can go by<br>
            But in the long run<br>
            There's still time to change the road you're on<br>
            And it makes me wonder</p>

        <p>Your head is humming and it won't go<br>
            In case you don't know<br>
            The piper's calling you to join him<br>
            Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow<br>
            And did you know<br>
            Your stairway lies on the whispering wind</p>

        <p>And as we wind on down the road<br>
            Our shadows taller than our soul<br>
            There walks a lady we all know<br>
            Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
            How everything still turns to gold<br>
            And if you listen very hard<br>
            The tune will come to you at last<br>
            When all are one and one is all<br>
            To be a rock and not to roll<br>
            And she's buying the stairway to heaven</p>
