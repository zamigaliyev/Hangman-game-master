        <h4>"Nothing Else Matters"</h4>

        <p>So close, no matter how far<br>
                Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
                Forever trusting who we are<br>
                And nothing else matters</p>

        <p>Never opened myself this way<br>
                Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
                All these words I don't just say<br>
                And nothing else matters</p>

        <p>Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
                Every day for us something new<br>
                Open mind for a different view<br>
                And nothing else matters</p>

        <p>Never cared for what they do<br>
                Never cared for what they know<br>
                But I know</p>

        <p>So close, no matter how far<br>

        <p>Never cared for what they say<br>
                Never cared for games they play<br>
                Never cared for what they do<br>
                Never cared for what they know<br>
                And I know, yeah!</p>

        <p>So close, no matter how far<br>
                Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
                Forever trusting who we are<br>
                No, nothing else matters</p>
