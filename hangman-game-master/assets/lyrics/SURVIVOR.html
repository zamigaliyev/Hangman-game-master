        <h4>"Eye of the Tiger"</h4>

        <p>Risin' up, back on the street<br>
            Did my time, took my chances<br>
            Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
            Just a man and his will to survive</p>

        <p>So many times, it happens too fast<br>
            You trade your passion for glory<br>
            Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
            You must fight just to keep them alive</p>

        <p>It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
            Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger</p>

        <p>Face to face, out in the heat<br>
            Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry<br>
            They stack the odds 'till we take to the street<br>
            For the kill with the skill to survive</p>

        <p>It's the eye of the tiger, it's the dream of the fight<br>
            Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger</p>

        <p>Risin' up, straight to the top<br>
            Had the guts, got the glory<br>
            Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop<br>
            Just a man and his will to survive</p>

        <p>It's the eye of the tiger, it's the dream of the fight<br>
            Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger</p>

        <p>The eye of the tiger<br>
            The eye of the tiger<br>
            The eye of the tiger<br>
            The eye of the tiger</p>
