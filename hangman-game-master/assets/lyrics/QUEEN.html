        <h4>"The Show Must Go On"</h4>

        <p>Empty spaces<br>
            What are we living for?<br>
            Abandoned places.<br>
            I guess we know the score.</p>

        <p>On and on.
            Does anybody know what we are looking for?</p>

        <p>Another hero,<br>
            Another mindless crime<br>
            Behind the curtain<br>
            In the pantomime.</p>

        <p>Hold the line.<br>
            Does anybody want to take it anymore?</p>

        <p>Show must go on.<br>
            Show must go on.<br>
            Inside my heart is breaking.<br>
            My make-up may be flaking.<br>
            But my smile still stays on.</p>

        <p>Whatever happens,<br>
            I'll leave it all to chance.<br>
            Another heartache,<br>
            Another failed romance.</p>

        <p>On and on.<br>
            Does anybody know what we are living for?</p>

        <p>I guess I'm learning.<br>
            I must be warmer now.<br>
            I'll soon be turning<br>
            'Round the corner now.</p>

        <p>Outside the dawn is breaking,
            But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.</p>

        <p>Show must go on.<br>
            Show must go on.<br>
            Inside my heart is breaking.<br>
            My make-up may be flaking,<br>
            But my smile still stays on.</p>

        <p>My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies.<br>
            Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die.<br>
            I can fly, my friends.</p>

        <p>Show must go on.<br>
            Show must go on.<br>
            I'll face it with a grin.<br>
            I'm never giving in<br>
            Ohâ€”with the show.</p>

        <p>I'll top the bill,<br>
            I'll overkill.<br>
            I have to find the will to carry on with the show.<br>
            On with the show.</p>

        <p>Show must go on.</p>
