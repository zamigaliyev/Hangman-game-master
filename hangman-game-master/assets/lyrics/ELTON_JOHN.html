        <h4>"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"</h4>

        <p>What have I got to do to make you love me<br>
        What have I got to do to make you care<br>
        What do I do when lightning strikes me<br>
        And I wake to find that you're not there?</p>

        <p>What have I got to do to make you want me<br>
        What have I got to do to be heard<br>
        What do I say when it's all over?<br>
        And sorry seems to be the hardest word</p>

        <p>It's sad, so sad (so sad)<br>
        It's a sad, sad situation<br>
        And it's getting more and more absurd<br>
        It's sad, so sad (so sad)<br>
        Why can't we talk it over?<br>
        Oh it seems to me<br>
        That sorry seems to be the hardest word</p>

        <p>It's sad, so sad (so sad)<br>
        It's a sad, sad situation<br>
        And it's getting more and more absurd<br>
        It's sad, so sad (so sad)<br>
        Why can't we talk it over?<br>
        Oh it seems to me<br>
        That sorry seems to be the hardest word</p>

        <p>What have I do to make you love me, oh<br>
        What have I got to do to be heard<br>
        What do I do when lightning strikes me<br>
        What have I got to do?<br>
        What have I got to do?<br>
        When sorry seems to be the hardest word</p>
