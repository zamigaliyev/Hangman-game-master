        <h4>"My Way"</h4>

        <p>And now, the end is near<br>
            And so I face the final curtain<br>
            My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
            I'll state my case, of which I'm certain</p>

        <p>I've lived a life that's full<br>
            I've traveled each and every highway<br>
            And more, much more than this<br>
            I did it my way</p>

        <p>Regrets, I've had a few<br>
            But then again, too few to mention<br>
            I did what I had to do<br>
            And saw it through without exemption</p>

        <p>I planned each charted course<br>
            Each careful step along the byway<br>
            And more, much more than this<br>
            I did it my way</p>

        <p>Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
            When I bit off more than I could chew<br>
            But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
            I ate it up and spit it out<br>
            I faced it all and I stood tall<br>
            And did it my way</p>

        <p>I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
            I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
            And now, as tears subside<br>
            I find it all, all so amusing</p>

        <p>To think I did all that<br>
            And may I say, not in a shy way<br>
            Oh no, no, not me<br>
            I did it my way</p>

        <p>For what is man, what has he got?<br>
            If not himself, then he has naught<br>
            To say the things he truly feels<br>
            And not the words of one who kneels<br>
            The record shows I took the blows<br>
            And did it my way</p>

        <p>And did it my way</p>
