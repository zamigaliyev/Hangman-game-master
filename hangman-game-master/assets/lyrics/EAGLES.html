        <h4>"Hotel California"</h4>

        <p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
        Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air<br>
        Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light<br>
        My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
        I had to stop for the night.</p>

        <p>There she stood in the doorway;<br>
        I heard the mission bell<br>
        And I was thinking to myself<br>
        'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'<br>
        Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
        There were voices down the corridor,<br>
        I thought I heard them say</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
        Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br>
        Such a lovely face.<br>
        Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
        Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here</p>

        <p>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends<br>
        She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends<br>
        How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat<br>
        Some dance to remember, some dance to forget</p>

        <p>So I called up the Captain,<br>
        'Please bring me my wine'<br>
        He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'<br>
        And still those voices are calling from far away,<br>
        Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
        Just to hear them say"</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
        Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br>
        Such a lovely face.<br>
        They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
        What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis</p>

        <p>Mirrors on the ceiling,<br>
        The pink champagne on ice<br>
        And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'<br>
        And in the master's chambers,<br>
        They gathered for the feast<br>
        They stab it with their steely knives,<br>
        But they just can't kill the beast</p>

        <p>Last thing I remember, I was<br>
        Running for the door<br>
        I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
        'Relax' said the night man,<br>
        'We are programmed to receive.<br>
        You can check out any time you like,<br>
        But you can never leave!'</p>
