        <h4>"Live Is Life"</h4>

        <p>Live<br>
            live is life<br>
            live<br>
            live.</p>

        <p>When we all give the power<br>
            we all give the best.<br>
            Every minute of an hour<br>
            don't think about a rest.<br>
            Then you all get the power<br>
            you all get the best.<br>
            When everyone gives everything and every song everybody sings.</p>

        <p>Then it's live<br>
            live is life<br>
            live is life<br>
            live.</p>

        <p>Live is life - when we all feel the power.<br>
            Live is life - come on<br>
            stand up and dance!</p>

        <p>Live is life - when the feeling of the people -<br>
            Live is life - is the feeling of the band.<br>
            When we all give the power<br>
            we all give the best. . . .</p>

        <p>Then it's live<br>
            live is life<br>
            live<br>
            live is life<br>
            live.<br>
            Live<br>
            live is life<br>
            live<br>
            live is life.</p>

        <p>And you call when it's over<br>
            you call it should last.<br>
            Every minute of the future is a memory of the past.<br>
            'Cause we all gave the power<br>
            we all gave the best.<br>
            And everyone gave everything and every song everybody sang.<br>
            Live is life.</p>
