        <h4>"Another Day in Paradise"</h4>

        <p>She calls out to the man on the street<br>
            'Sir, can you help me?<br>
            It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,<br>
            Is there somewhere you can tell me?'</p>

        <p>He walks on, doesn't look back<br>
            He pretends he can't hear her<br>
            Starts to whistle as he crosses the street<br>
            Seems embarrassed to be there</p>

        <p>Oh think twice, it's another day for you and me in paradise<br>
            Oh think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you,<br>
            You and me in paradise, think about it</p>

        <p>She calls out to the man on the street<br>
            He can see she's been crying<br>
            She's got blisters on the soles of her feet<br>
            She can't walk but she's trying</p>

        <p>Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise<br>
            Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,<br>
            You and me in paradise, think about it</p>

        <p>Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do<br>
            Oh Lord, there must be something you can say</p>

        <p>You can tell from the lines on her face<br>
            You can see that she's been there<br>
            Probably been moved on from every place<br>
            Cause she didn't fit in there</p>

        <p>Oh think twice, 'cause another day for you and me in paradise<br>
            Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,<br>
            You and me in paradise, just think about it, think about it</p>

        <p>It's just another day for you and me in paradise<br>
            It's just another day for you and me in paradise, paradise<br>
            It's just another day for you and me in paradise<br>
            It's just another day for you and me in paradise, paradise<br>
            It's just another day for you and me<br>
            It's just another day for you and me<br>
            It's just another day for you and me in paradise<br>
            In paradise</p>
